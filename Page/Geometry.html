                    <p class="lead mb-0"><strong>Distance and Midpoint</strong><br>Distance Formula: This formula calculates the distance between two points with coordinates (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) on a coordinate plane. Distance = √[(x2 - x1)² + (y2 - y1)²]<br>Midpoint Formula: This formula finds the midpoint coordinates of a line segment given the coordinates of its endpoints (x1, y1) and (x2, y2). Midpoint coordinates = ((x1 + x2) / 2, (y1 + y2) / 2)<br><strong>Lines and Angles</strong><br>Linear Equation of a Line: This equation expresses the relationship between the x and y coordinates of points on a straight line. It can be in slope-intercept form (y = mx + b) or point-slope form (y - y1 = m(x - x1)) where m is the slope and b is the y-intercept.<br><strong>Triangles</strong><br>Pythagorean Theorem: This theorem relates the sides of a right triangle. It states that a² + b² = c², where a and b are the lengths of the legs (sides opposite and adjacent to the right angle), and c is the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle). Area of a Triangle: This formula calculates the area of a triangle. Area = ½ * base * height, where base is the length of any side of the triangle and height is the perpendicular distance from that base to the opposite vertex.<br><strong>Quadrilaterals</strong><br>Area of a Rectangle: This formula finds the area of a rectangle. Area = length * width, where length and width are the dimensions of the rectangle. <br>Area of a Parallelogram: Similar to a rectangle, the area of a parallelogram is calculated by multiplying its base by the height. Area = base * height <br><strong>Circles</strong><br>Circumference of a Circle: This formula calculates the distance around the circle. Circumference = 2πr, where r is the circle's radius and π (pi) is a mathematical constant approximately equal to 3.14.<br>Area of a Circle: This formula finds the area enclosed by the circle. Area = πr², where r is the circle's radius and π (pi) is a mathematical constant.<br><strong>Volume and Surface Area</strong><br>Volume of a Prism: This formula calculates the volume of a prism (rectangular or triangular). Volume = base area * depth, where base area is the area of the prism's base and depth is the distance between the parallel faces.<br>Volume of a Cylinder: This formula finds the volume of a cylinder. Volume = πr²h, where r is the cylinder's radius, h is its height, and π (pi) is a mathematical constant.<br>Volume of a Cone: This formula calculates the volume of a cone. Volume = (1/3)πr²h, where r is the cone's radius, h is its height, and π (pi) is a mathematical constant.<br>Volume of a Sphere: This formula finds the volume of a sphere. Volume = (4/3)πr³, where r is the sphere's radius and π (pi) is a mathematical constant.</p>
